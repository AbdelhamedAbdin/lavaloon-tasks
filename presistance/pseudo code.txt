- I need to loop the code every time to check on the data.

- a num should bigger than 9 or will be equation to 0 if it is smaller than it.

- I need to separate the numbers separately.

- the numbers cannot iterable so I have to put it as a string then I'll modify it again as an integer.

- I have to do multiplication in all of the numbers that exists in my list together.
